How to Use:
*Setup*
A webserver is reqired to host invoke-mimikatz and receive.php
to accept the POST request sent from pwd_dumper.bat
This way the creds are saved to an external location and you can
run it remotely from a regular USB.

Modify pwd_dumper.bat and change both 'enter_server_address"
entries to the webserver address you are using. The first one being
the location of where you saved Invoke-Mimikatz, and the second the
location of receive.php

**Usage**
Execute the .bat file as an administrator.
That's it!
